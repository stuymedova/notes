# Computational complexity

I find that the word "complexity" is a very abstract word to describe the mechanism for measuring the performance of algorithms. Since we're actually measuring the scalability of algorithms, not their absolute performance, I think the word "scalability" would be better suited for that instead.

Prompted the idea: [WWDC18 Embracing Algorithms](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/223/), where actually beautifully explained the role algorithms play in App development.
