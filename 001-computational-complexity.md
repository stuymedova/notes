# Computational complexity

"Computational complexity" is a common industry term that is used along with the measurement of the performance of algorithms. But since the term "complexity" is very abstract and what we're actually measuring is the scalability of algorithms, not their absolute performance, I suggest the word "scalability" would be better suited for that instead.
