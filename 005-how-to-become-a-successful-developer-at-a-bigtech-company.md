# How to become a successful developer at a bigtech company

1. Get a really good manager or tech lead. Ask around about the career history of your TL/manager's underlings. Have they been successful?

2. Pick high profile projects: Again, what's good for a company isn't necessarily what's going to be rewarded. The meaty maintenance issues are important, but they won't be rewarded. You want to pick the project that people know and understand. You want as many people as possible to recognize your impact.

3. Tackle the meaty problems: You not only want to be on the coolest projects, but you also want to tackle the biggest problems. Seek out the problems that are widely understandable and have tangible, or ideally measurable, impacts.

4. Bigtech companies are full of distractions. Take as many of those off your plate as possible while you're ramping up.

5. Never believe anything management tells you. They don't lie deliberately but frequently things change very quickly, so what's true one day is not true the next.
