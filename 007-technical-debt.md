# Technical debt

Tip: Stop using the term "technical debt". It implies you could pay it off and be done. Instead use "architectural investment". As in, "our current architectural investment is insufficient". This changes the reception from "you made a mistake and have to correct it" to "you are making an ongoing investment that will reap benefits". Management will be more receptive to invest in the product than in paying off some nebulous debt.

How much investment is enough? The best answer I've heard is from Mark Hamburg: "I don't know what the correct answer is, but I know it is more than 50% [of the team resources], for the simple reason that it is easier to make a mess than it is to clean it up".

If your code base is dacaying faster than it is improving, your investment is insufficient.
