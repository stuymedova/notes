# How to become a successful developer

1. Reinvent the wheel. Others will tell you not to, but they’ve never attempted to build wheels before. They probably don’t understand wheels. Maybe they’re the type that buys a new truck when all they need is a new wheel. Learn how to make wheels.

2. Know when to use an off the shelf wheel. Sometimes there’s no time to build new wheels. Reinvent the wheel once you have time though.

3. Learn from the best by reading open source code. They do the same; that’s why they’re the best.

4. Publish everything you do. If it’s bad: people don’t care. If it’s useful, people will be grateful. It doesn’t matter if you plan on maintaining it / polishing it. Release it now, or risk never releasing it at all.

5. Keep enjoying what you do. There will be times when you don’t, but that’s fine. Eventually you’ll find something that’s interesting again. If you feel like your daily routine is constricting you: change the routine. Being a developer is very lucrative, changing directions is worth it.
